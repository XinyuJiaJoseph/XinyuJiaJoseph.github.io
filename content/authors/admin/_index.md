I am a first-year PhD student (from 10/2023) in the [Information School, the University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/is). My research interest is in investing the academic information seeking behavior transitions of international students when they study abroad. I am also interested in broad information behavior research.

Before starting my PhD study, I got my Bachelor of Internet of Things Engineering in [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/), China. After having background experience in computer science, I entered the Information School and obtained a Master of Science degree in Information Management. During my master's study, I gained my interest in information behavior research and was able to join the Information School to continue my PhD study.
